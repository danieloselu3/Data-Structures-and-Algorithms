Space complexity is the amount of space(including input values to the algoritm) used by the program to execute the algorithm.

For any algorithm, memory may be used for the following;
    1.Storing variables.
    2.Program instructions.
    3.Execution.

Auxiliary space is the space used up during execution.
 i.e Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input Space

 During execution, Algorithms may use memory for three reasons;
    1.Instruction space. --> memory used to save the compiled version of the instructions.
    2.Environmental stack. --> Sometimes , an algorithm(function) may be called inside another algorithm(function).In such a situation, the current variables are pushed into the system stack temporarily as the await further instructions.
    3.Data space. --> amount of space used by the variables and constants.
