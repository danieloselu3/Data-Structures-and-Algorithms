Bubble sort compares all the elements, one by one and sorts them based on their values.

It is known as bubble sort because with every iteration, the highest element in the given array, bubbles up towards the last place , just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface.

sorting takes place by stepping through all the elements one-by-one and comparing it with the adjacent element and swapping them if required.

Implementing Bubble sort
    1.Starting with the first element(index=0) compare the current element with the next element of the array.
    2.If the current element is greater than the next element of the array, swap them.
    3.If the current element is less than the next element, move to the next element.Repeat from step 1.

Complexity analysis of bubble sort.
  Time Complexity of bubble sort is O(n**2)
  Space complexity of bubble sort is O(1) because only a single additional space is required(for holding the temporary variable).
  The main advantage of bubble sort is the simplicity of the algorithm.
