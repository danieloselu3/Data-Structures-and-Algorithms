Asymptotic notations is a way of representing time and space complexity of an algorithm.

We have 3 Types of Asymptotic notations
    1.Big Theta --> Represents the average time taken to execute an algorithm of any given kind.
    2.Big Oh --> Represents the upper bound, or the worst case scenario that it takes to execute an algorithm.
    3.Big Omega --> Represents the lower bound, or the best case scenario that it takes to execute an algorithm.
