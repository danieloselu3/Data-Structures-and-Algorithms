Time Complexity signifies the total amount of time required by the program to run till it's execution.

The time complexity of an algorithm is mostly expressed in Big-O notation.

We can calculate time complexity in several ways
    1.Linear Time Complexity O(n) --> run time depends on the value of n. If n doubles, so does the time complexity.
    2.Quadratic Time Complexity O(n**k) 'k is any constant > 1' --> run time is directly proportional to the power of n "constant k".
    3.Logarithmic Time Complexity O(log n)
    4.Exponential Time Complexity n*log(n)
